# Simple Bitcoin
Understanding the mechanics of Bitcoin using Python3, the accompanying source files to [my blog post](http://www.samlewis.me/2017/06/a-peek-under-bitcoins-hood/).

The files in this repo do just enough to allow you to generate an address, make a transaction and then submit that transaction to the Bitcoin blockchain.

* `bitcoin_address_utils.py` contains code to generate a Bitcoin address
* `bitcoin_transaction_utils.py` contains code to generate a signed Bitcoin transaction
* `bitcoin_p2p_message_utils.py` contains code to submit a signed transaction to the Bitcoin blockchain, via the peer to peer network
